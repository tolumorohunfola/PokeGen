# PokeGen

This is a cool pokemon web app! We don't know what it will do!

What we want the project to do 
1. pull pokemon image
2. say pokemon name
3. random pokemons
4. store people's pokemon on the database
5. tell people which pokemon they currently have

## Setting up Conda environment

### Create the environment

In your conda terminal, create the conda environemnt with:

`conda create -n PokeGen python=3.9`

To activate the evironment (so that you can use it) you should enter:

`conda activate PokeGen`

### Install relevant packages

Activate the PokeGen environment, and then install Flask with

`pip install flask`

### Use and run python code

Once you activate the environment, you can then enter in the terminal:

`python script.py`

Which is an example of running the script.py with this environment
